fid-sdk-web v2.0.0 integration documentation for WEB

# Introduce
FID SDK is a library for web to interact with FID Platform. FID SDK includes the following main functions:
- Support init, login, get user's information and logout

## Support
If you have any questions you could:

- Contact directly via email with the SDK team for assistance or contact us at [ftech.ai](https://ftech.ai/)

## Step 1: Registration
Contact us to register your Web App in our system. 

Base on standard OIDC, you must give us redirect_uri, scope, response_type....

We'll give you client_id, client_secret(optional), authority

Ftech will provide client_id, client_secret(optional), accept CORS and some other informations for you.

Then, you can using third party client SDK for communicating with [OAuth2.0](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749) and [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) providers to login/register/logout/reset password...

You have better choice library that supports the [PKCE](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636) extensions for OAuth, which was created to secure authorization codes in public clients when custom URI scheme redirects are used.

We suggest you using this [library](https://github.com/IdentityModel/oidc-client-js/wiki)

## Step 2 (Optional): Save AccessToken and RefreshToken
When you have AccessToken and RefreshToken after finish step 1, you must save them as cookies with below rules

- You save AccessToken with name *access_token*
- You save RefreshToken with name *refresh_token*
